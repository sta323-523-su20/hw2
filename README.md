# STA 323 / 523 :: Homework 2

## Introduction

Writing clean and elegant code is more that just following a specific style. It 
involves a continuous work flow of rewriting, restructuring, and rethinking how 
your code functions. Homework 2 will get you started in the journey of 
developing code that smells good.

## Tasks

### Part I

Tasks 1 and 2 will give you some more background information and prepare you
to successfully complete Part II.

#### Task 1

- Read sections [13.1 - 13.4](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/s3.html) in Advanced R by
  Hadley Wickham.

- Watch [Code Smells and Feels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oyiPBjLAWY) by
  Jenny Bryan. Her slides and related materials are available on GitHub 
  [here](https://github.com/jennybc/code-smells-and-feels).

- Watch [Handing Merge Conflicts](https://warpwire.duke.edu/w/i8gDAA/) and 
  [Working with Branches](https://warpwire.duke.edu/w/lcgDAA/) to 
  understand the work flow for this team-based assessment.

#### Task 2

As a team, agree on a common coding style. You may want to refresh yourself with
Hadley's [style guide](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/style.html) before you agree
on a consistent style.

### Part II

Read through Tasks 3 - 6 to get an idea of Part II's purpose. As a point of
reference, one working example for inspiration of an S3 class is given by the 
"Roman" class. See  `?utils::as.roman()`.

<i>
A portion of the total points for this part will be allocated to the
creativity and complexity of the class and methods you create.
</i>

#### Task 3

Create a new class for the S3 OOP system. For your class, include constructor, 
validator, and helper functions as explained in section 13.3 of
<i>Advanced R</i>.

#### Task 4

Create two (three for graduate student teams) methods for your newly defined 
class in Task 3. These methods should
use existing generic functions such as `print()`, `summary()`, `plot()`, etc.
Function `sloop::is_S3_generic()` can help you identify which `base` R functions
are S3 generics.

#### Task 5

Demonstrate your class and methods with two examples for each method.

#### Task 6

Provide a brief write-up that explains your class and methods. Also, 
discuss weaknesses and possible improvements to your class and methods.

## Essential details

#### Deadline and submission

**The deadline to submit Homework 2 is 11:59am ET on Wednesday, May 27.** Only
your final commit and code in the master branch will be graded. 

#### Help

- Post your questions in the #hw2 channel on Slack. Explain your error / problem
  in as much detail as possible or give a reproducible example that generates 
  the same error. Make use of the code snippet option available in Slack.

- Visit the instructor or TAs in Zoom office hours.

- The instructor and TAs will not answer any questions within 6 hours of the
  deadline.

#### Academic integrity

This is a team assignment. You should not communicate with other
teams. As a reminder, any code you use directly or as inspiration must be cited.

*Undergraduate:*
